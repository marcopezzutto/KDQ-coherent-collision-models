We determine the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) distribution associated to the stochastic instances
of internal energy variations for the quantum system and environmental particles in coherent Markovian collision
models. In the case the interactions between the quantum system and the particles do not conserve energy, the
KDQ of the non-energy-preserving stochastic work is also derived. These KDQ distributions can account for
non-commutativity, and return the unperturbed average values and variances for a generic interaction-time,
and generic local initial states of the quantum system and environmental particles. Using this nonequilibrium-
physics approach, we certify the conditions under which the collision process of the model exhibits quantum
traits, and we quantify the rate of energy exchanged by the quantum system by looking at the variance of the
KDQ energy distributions. Finally, we propose an experimental test of our results on a superconducting quantum
circuit implementing a qubit system, with microwave photons representing the environmental particles.
